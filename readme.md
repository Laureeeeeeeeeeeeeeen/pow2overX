#### A question:
Does there exist a power of 2 that is divisible by X?

#### Unless X is itself a power of 2, then no.


###### Informal proof:
<pre>
Given:  
   2ⁿ is equal to 2 multiplied by itself n times.  
        2³ = (2 x 2 x 2)  
    Every non-prime number can be broken down into factors.  
        24 --> 2 x 2 x 2 x 3  
        This is called prime factorization.  
Proof:  
    2ⁿ is calculated by multiplication of the number 2 by the number 2.  
    The prime factorization of 2ⁿ can only contain the number 2.  
    ∴  
    Any integer 2ⁿ is only divisible by numbers that  
    can be expressed in the format 2^k where k≥0.
